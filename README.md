Here is a list of ideas that I would like to work on but don't necessarily have time to, so I'd like to share. Hopefully, if you pick one up, you'll include me somehow.

## Projects

  * JavaScript skills game - a (browser) console game to test cadidate skills or be used in an interview.
    *  [Jasper](http://kalisjoshua.github.io/Jasper)
  * Hypermedia API Maze - create a maze with tokens to be searched for by "bots" which are essentially Hypermedia clients.
    * [Longleet](https://github.com/kalisjoshua/longleet)
  * Distributed Network - create nodes of a web where each node knows about the others in the cluster and monitors their status.
  * 50 Questions - web based 50 questions game
  * Social Coder Mashup - combine the following: [Open Source Report Card](http://osrc.dfm.io/), [GitHub Resume](http://resume.github.io/), recommendations on [LinkedIn](https://developer.linkedin.com/apis) (maybe?)
